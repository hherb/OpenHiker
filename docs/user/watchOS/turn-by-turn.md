# Turn-by-Turn Navigation

Follow a planned route on your wrist with turn-by-turn directions, haptic feedback, and off-route warnings.

## Starting Navigation

1. Swipe to the **Routes** tab
2. Tap the route you want to follow
3. Navigation starts immediately — the map shows your route as a line overlay

## Navigation Display

### Top Banner
- **Turn direction icon** — Arrow showing the next turn direction
- **Distance** — Countdown to the next turn (e.g., "200m", "50m")
- **Instruction** — Trail/road name or action (e.g., "Turn left onto Ridge Trail")

### Bottom Bar
- **Progress bar** — Visual indicator of how far along the route you are
- **Remaining distance** — How far to the destination
- **Percentage** — Completion percentage (e.g., "42%")

## Haptic Feedback

Your watch taps your wrist at key moments:

| Event | Distance | Feedback |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Approaching turn** | ~100m before | Gentle tap |
| **At turn** | ~30m | Stronger tap |
| **Off route** | >50m from route | Alert pattern |
| **Arrived** | At destination | Success pattern |

## Off-Route Warning

If you stray more than **50 meters** from the planned route:

- The navigation overlay turns **red**
- A warning triangle appears
- **"OFF ROUTE"** text displays
- Haptic alert taps your wrist
- A "Return to trail" message is shown

The warning clears automatically when you return within range of the route.

## Stopping Navigation

1. Swipe to the **Routes** tab
2. Tap **"Stop Navigation"** (red button)

Or simply start navigating a different route — the previous one is replaced.

## Tips for Trail Navigation

- **Start with heading-up mode** — Tap the Center button twice so the map rotates with your walking direction. This makes "turn left" and "turn right" intuitive.
- **Use the Minimalist Navigation view** for longer hikes — it saves significant battery by not rendering the map. See [Minimalist Navigation](minimalist-nav.md).
- **Check your route before starting** — Glance at the turn list on your iPhone before heading out so you know what to expect.
