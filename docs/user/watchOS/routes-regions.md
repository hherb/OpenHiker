# Routes & Regions

Manage your offline map regions and planned routes on the watch.

## Regions Tab

Swipe to the **Regions** tab to see all downloaded map regions on your watch.

Each region shows:
- Region name
- Tile count

### Loading a Region
Tap a region to load it into the map view. The most recently used region loads automatically on app startup.

### Auto-Region Selection
When you start the app, OpenHiker automatically:
1. Checks if the most recently used region covers your current GPS location
2. If not, searches other local regions for a match
3. If no local region matches, requests one from your iPhone

### Managing Regions
- **Swipe right** on a region to rename it
- Regions are received from your iPhone via WatchConnectivity

## Routes Tab

Swipe to the **Routes** tab to see all planned routes available on your watch.

Each route shows:
- Route name
- Distance (km or mi)
- Estimated duration

### Starting Navigation
Tap a route to begin turn-by-turn navigation. The app switches to the Map tab (or Minimalist Navigation tab if that setting is enabled) and starts guiding you.

### Managing Routes
- **Swipe right** on a route to rename it
- **Swipe left** on a route to delete it
- **Tap "Stop Navigation"** (red button, shown during active navigation) to end the current route

### Getting Routes onto Your Watch

Routes are sent from your iPhone:
1. On iPhone, open a planned route
2. Tap **Send to Watch**
3. The route appears in the watch's Routes tab

Routes also sync via iCloud — any route planned on your iPhone or Mac appears on the watch automatically.
