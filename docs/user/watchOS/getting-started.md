# Getting Started with OpenHiker for Apple Watch

## Installation

OpenHiker for Apple Watch is installed alongside the iPhone app. Open the **Watch** app on your iPhone and ensure OpenHiker is installed.

## First Launch

When you open OpenHiker on your watch for the first time:

1. **Location permission** — Allow location access for GPS tracking
2. **HealthKit permission** — Allow health data access for heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring (optional but recommended)
3. **Map view** — The app opens to the Map tab showing a placeholder if no region is loaded

## Getting Maps onto Your Watch

Before you can use the offline map, you need to transfer a map region from your iPhone:

### Method 1: Transfer from iPhone
1. On your **iPhone**, open OpenHiker
2. Download a map region (see [iOS Downloading Maps](../iOS/downloading-maps.md))
3. Go to the **Watch** tab on your iPhone
4. Tap **Send All Regions to Watch**, or send individual regions

### Method 2: Request from Watch
If you're on the trail and realize you need a map:
1. On the watch Map tab, tap **"Request Map from iPhone"**
2. Your iPhone downloads tiles for your current location and sends them
3. This requires your iPhone to be reachable (Bluetooth or shared Wi-Fi)

> **Note:** On-demand requests are rate-limited to once every 10 minutes.
