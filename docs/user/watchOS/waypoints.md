# Waypoints

Drop waypoints directly from your wrist to mark points of interest on the trail.

## Dropping a Waypoint

1. Tap the **orange pin** button in the map toolbar
2. The waypoint sheet opens showing your current GPS coordinates
3. Choose a **category** from the 3×3 grid:

| Icon | Category | Use For |
|------|----------|---------|
| Signpost | Trail Marker | Trail junctions, blazes, signs |
| Eye | Viewpoint | Scenic overlooks, panoramas |
| Drop | Water Source | Streams, springs, water taps |
| Tent | Campsite | Camping areas, bivouac spots |
| Warning | Danger | Hazardous sections, cliff edges |
| Fork/Knife | Food | Rest stops, picnic areas |
| House | Shelter | Shelters, huts, emergency refuges |
| Car | Parking | Trailhead parking |
| Pin | Custom | Anything else |

4. Optionally add a **label** using voice dictation
5. Tap **Save**

## Waypoint Display

Waypoints appear on the map as their category icon. They are visible at all zoom levels so you can always spot them.

## Syncing

Waypoints sync automatically:
- **To iPhone** — When your watch connects to your iPhone, new waypoints transfer
- **From iPhone** — Waypoints created on your iPhone also appear on the watch map

## Tips

- **Drop waypoints generously** — Mark water sources, trail junctions, and hazards as you go. They help you on the return trip and benefit future hikers.
- **Use voice dictation** for labels — It's much faster than typing on the tiny watch keyboard.
- **Category icons** are visible even when zoomed out, so use distinctive categories to quickly identify points on the map.
