# Getting Started with OpenHiker for iOS

## Installation

Install OpenHiker from the App Store or build from source via Xcode.

## First Launch

When you open OpenHiker for the first time:

1. **Location permission** — OpenHiker asks for location access. Choose "While Using the App" for GPS tracking and navigation. You can change this later in Settings > Privacy > Location Services.

2. **Main screen** — You'll see a tab bar at the bottom (iPhone) or a sidebar (iPad) with these sections:
   - **Navigate** — Turn-by-turn guidance and live tracking
   - **Regions** — Interactive map for downloading offline tiles
   - **Downloaded** — Your saved map regions
   - **Hikes** — Recorded GPS tracks and stats
   - **Routes** — Planned routes with turn-by-turn directions
   - **Community** — Browse and share routes
   - **Watch** — Apple Watch sync status

## What to Do First

1. **Go to the Regions tab** and download a map region covering your area
2. **Plan a route** or browse Community routes for inspiration
3. **If you have an Apple Watch**, go to the Watch tab to transfer your map
