# Waypoints

Waypoints let you mark and remember points of interest on the trail — water sources, viewpoints, campsites, hazards, and more.

## Dropping a Waypoint

You can drop a waypoint from the **Regions** tab map:

1. Position the map so the crosshair is at the desired location
2. Tap the **drop pin** button
3. Choose a **category**:

| Category | Icon | Use For |
|----------|------|---------|
| Scenic View | Eye | Viewpoints, overlooks, photo spots |
| Water Source | Drop | Streams, springs, water taps |
| Campsite | Tent | Camping areas, bivouac spots |
| Danger | Warning | Hazardous sections, cliff edges |
| Wildlife | Paw | Animal sighting locations |
| Photo Spot | Camera | Particularly photogenic locations |
| Custom | Pin | Anything else |

4. Add an optional **label** (e.g., "Spring by the old oak")
5. Tap **Save**

### Waypoints List (iPad)
On iPad, a dedicated **Waypoints** tab shows all waypoints grouped by category with:

## Waypoints on Apple Watch

Waypoints you create on your iPhone automatically transfer to your Apple Watch. You can also drop waypoints directly from the watch — see the [watchOS manual](../watchOS/README.md).
