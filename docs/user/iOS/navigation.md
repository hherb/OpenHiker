## Turn-by-Turn Guidance

When navigating a route, the top of the screen shows:

- **Turn direction icon** (arrow indicating left, right, straight, etc.)
- **Distance to next turn** (counts down as you approach)
- **Current road/trail name**
- Instructions advance automatically as you reach each turn

## Map Controls

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Map orientation** | Toggle between heads-up (map rotates with you) and north-up |
| **Recenter** | Snap the map back to your current position |
| **Map style** | Switch between Roads, Trails, and Cycling views |
| **Download region** | Save the current visible area for offline use |

## GPS Accuracy

Tap the GPS accuracy picker to choose:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **High** | Best GPS accuracy — uses more battery |
| **Balanced** | Good accuracy with moderate battery use |
| **Low power** | Reduced accuracy, longest battery life |

## Free-Form Tracking

You don't need a planned route to record a hike:

1. Tap the **Record** button (circle icon) to start GPS tracking
2. Walk your route — your track appears as a blue line
3. Tap **Stop** when finished
4. You'll be prompted to save the hike with a name and optional comment

## Live Statistics

The bottom bar shows real-time stats during tracking:

- **Distance** traveled
- **Elevation gain / loss**
- **Duration**
- **Walking vs resting time**

### Apple Watch Health Data

If your Apple Watch is running an OpenHiker workout simultaneously, the navigation screen also displays:

- **Heart rate** (current BPM)
- **Blood oxygen** (SpO2 %)
- **UV index**

## Offline Navigation

Navigation works fully offline as long as you have:

- A downloaded map region covering the area
- A planned route (for turn-by-turn guidance)

The map tiles, routing data, and GPS all work without an internet connection.
