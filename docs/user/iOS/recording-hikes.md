# Recording Hikes

OpenHiker records your GPS track, elevation data, and health metrics while you hike.

## Starting a Recording

There are two ways to record:

1. **Navigate tab** — Tap the Record button for free-form tracking, or start navigating a route (recording starts automatically)
2. **Regions tab** — Tap the track recording button on the map

## During Your Hike

While recording, OpenHiker captures:

- GPS coordinates at regular intervals
- Altitude readings from GPS and barometer
- Walking vs resting time (based on movement speed)
- Total distance via cumulative GPS points
- Health data from Apple Watch (if connected)

## Saving Your Hike

When you stop recording:

1. A save prompt appears with:
   - **Auto-generated name** (based on date)
   - **Editable name field** — give it a descriptive name
   - **Comment field** — add notes about conditions, highlights, etc.
2. Tap **Save** to store the hike

## Viewing Saved Hikes

Go to the **Hikes** tab to see all your recorded hikes sorted by date (newest first). Use the search bar to filter by name.

Each hike in the list shows:
- Name and date
- Distance
- Duration
- Elevation gain
