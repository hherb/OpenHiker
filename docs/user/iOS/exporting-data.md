# Exporting Data

OpenHiker lets you export your hikes in multiple formats for sharing, archiving, or importing into other apps.

## Export Formats

- Hike name and date
- All statistics (distance, elevation, duration, etc.)
- Waypoints with coordinates and notes
- Your comments

Saved as a `.md` file that you can view in any text editor or notes app.

### Detailed Report (PDF)

A professional multi-page report containing:

GPX files can be imported into virtually any GPS or mapping application (Garmin Connect, Strava, AllTrails, Google Earth, etc.).
