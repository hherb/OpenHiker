# Settings & Preferences

OpenHiker remembers your preferences across sessions.

## Map Preferences

### Map Style
Your preferred map style (Roads, Trails, or Cycling) is saved separately for:
- **Region selector** — Defaults to Trails (topographic)
- **Navigation view** — Defaults to Roads

Switch styles anytime using the segmented control at the top of each map view.

### Last Viewed Location
The map remembers where you were last looking and returns to the same position on relaunch.

## Units

OpenHiker supports metric and imperial units:

| Metric | Imperial |
|--------|----------|
| Kilometers (km) | Miles (mi) |
| Meters (m) | Feet (ft) |
| km/h | mph |

The unit preference is applied throughout the app — distances, elevations, speeds, and all statistics.

## Community Profile

For sharing routes with the community, you can set:

- **Author name** — Your display name on shared routes
- **Default country** — Pre-filled when uploading routes
- **Default area** — Pre-filled when uploading routes

## iCloud Sync

OpenHiker automatically syncs the following data across your Apple devices via iCloud:

- Planned routes
- Saved hikes/routes
- Waypoints

Sync happens automatically when:
- The app launches
- Changes are made on another device (push notification)

You can trigger a manual sync from the Watch tab or by pulling to refresh in list views.

> **Note:** Map tiles (MBTiles files) are NOT synced via iCloud due to their large size. Download regions individually on each device, or use P2P transfer.

## GPS Accuracy

Available in the Navigate tab:

| Mode | Accuracy | Battery Impact |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **High** | Best GPS | Higher battery usage |
| **Balanced** | Good GPS | Moderate battery usage |
| **Low Power** | Reduced GPS | Longest battery life |

## Dark Mode

OpenHiker follows your system appearance setting. To switch between light and dark mode, go to **iOS Settings > Display & Brightness**.
