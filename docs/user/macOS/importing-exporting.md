# Importing & Exporting

OpenHiker for Mac supports importing GPX routes and exporting hike data in multiple formats.

## Importing GPX Files

### Via Keyboard Shortcut
Press **Cmd+I** to open the import dialog.

### Via Menu
**File → Import GPX...**

### Import Process
1. A native macOS file picker opens
2. Select one or more `.gpx` or `.xml` files (multi-select supported)
3. Routes are parsed and added to your planned routes list
4. A success alert shows how many routes were imported

### What Gets Imported
- **Track name** from GPX metadata
- **Track points** with latitude, longitude, and elevation
- **Computed statistics** — distance, elevation gain/loss, estimated duration

Imported routes appear in the **Routes** section and sync to your other devices via iCloud.

## Exporting Hike Data

From any hike's detail view, click the **export menu** in the toolbar:
