# Community Routes

The **Community** section lets you browse hiking and cycling routes shared by other OpenHiker users.

## Browsing Routes

The community routes are loaded from the OpenHikerRoutes GitHub repository.

Each route in the list shows:
- Route name
- Country and area (e.g., "Yosemite, USA")
- Distance and elevation gain
- Activity type icon (hiking/cycling)

### Searching
Use the search bar to filter by name, country, or area.

### Refreshing
Click the **refresh** button in the toolbar to reload the latest routes.

## Route Count

The section title shows the total number of available routes (e.g., "Community Routes (127)").

## Loading States

- **Error** — An error message with a retry button if the fetch fails
- **Empty** — A placeholder if no routes are available

## Downloading Routes

Browse the list and find routes in areas you're planning to visit. Community routes can be saved for offline reference (functionality shared with the iOS app's community features).
