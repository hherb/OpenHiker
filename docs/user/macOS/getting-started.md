# Getting Started with OpenHiker for macOS

## Installation

Install OpenHiker from the Mac App Store or build from source via Xcode.

## First Launch

When you open OpenHiker for the first time:

1. **Location permission** — OpenHiker may ask for location access to center the map on your position. This is optional — you can browse the map and plan routes without it.

2. **Sidebar navigation** — The left sidebar shows all sections:
   - **Regions** — Download map tiles for offline use
   - **Downloaded** — Manage your saved map regions
   - **Hikes** — Review recorded hikes from your watch or iPhone
   - **Waypoints** — View and manage all waypoints
   - **Routes** — Plan new routes and manage existing ones
   - **Community** — Browse routes shared by other hikers

3. **iCloud sync** — At the bottom of the sidebar, an iCloud sync bar lets you trigger manual sync. Data syncs automatically on launch.

## What to Do First

1. **Download a region** — Click "Regions" in the sidebar to open the map browser
2. **Import GPX routes** — Press Cmd+I to import existing routes from other apps
3. **Plan routes** — Select a region with routing data and create hiking/cycling routes
4. **Review hikes** — If you've recorded hikes on your iPhone or Apple Watch, they appear here via iCloud sync

## Window Size

The app has a minimum window size of 900×600 points. Resize the window or use full screen for the best experience, especially when planning routes.
